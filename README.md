# Project3-IndexGenerator

This is our Automatic Index Generator. 

Both indexes will automatically be created and saved to src file:  
  -MapIndex.txt   
  -UnorderedMapIndex.txt 
  
The program will print the execution times for creating both files. 
You will be given the option to search for a word, or enter 0 to exit the program.  
 
If word search performed, the program will print out the number of instances of the word in the text file, the lines on which the word is found,
and the times for searching through the map and unordered_map.
